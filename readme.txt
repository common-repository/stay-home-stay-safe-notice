== Description ==

This plugin lets you easily display a notice on your website with an extremely important message during the Coronavirus crisis: "Stay Home. Stay Safe. Save Lives".

During this global crisis we all need to come together and help, so many people are still not staying at home in countries when they should be, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a website owner you can do your bit to help by displaying a key message!

The notice will only appear on Mobile devices, if you wish to see it on your website after enabling the plugin, resize your window on desktop to less than 600px. The idea is that on a desktop or tablet device the user is most likely at home where as on their Mobile device they are more likely outside of home and should be reminded.

You can have this message display as a notice at the bottom of your website on every page (similar to a cookie notice). You can also have this appear at the top or bottom of every page or page. As a widget or using the Shortcode [stayhome]. You can configure  most these settings in the plugins settings where you would like the notice to appear.
